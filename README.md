# 👋 Welcome to the Roadsurfer Backend Challenge

## 🎯 Goal
Your goal is to:
- Analyze the changes introduced in the pull request
- Identify potential issues or bugs
- Suggest improvements in design, structure, readability, performance, and security
- Think out loud and explain your reasoning clearly

We’re interested in **how you think**, how you **communicate technical feedback**, and how you approach **realistic backend problems**.

You’ll receive a link to the pull request **30 minutes before the interview**, giving you time to prepare your thoughts.

Good luck and enjoy! 🚐
